# Pokébase

Pokébase is a single-page web application which can be used to both generate arbitrary lists of Pokémon and 
visualize that data with charts.

Check out the live version here: https://pokebase-app.azurewebsites.net/

## Usage

On the "Selection Criteria" tab select the criteria for any Pokémon which you wish to see. When you're done
hit the query button, and you'll be brought to the "Results & Charts" section to view the results. From there
you can use the "Copy/Export List" button to copy that list to the clipboard, or export it to a .csv file. 
You may also further refine the results by clicking on the pie slices in the different graphs.
